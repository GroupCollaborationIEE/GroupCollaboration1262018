	<p class="fancy"> Within in the recent years, news has become more focused on the events <br />
	that have been going on worldwide, and it has reduced the focus on our local news. <br />
	Many major news app put all of their attention on the stories and coverage that <br />
    is on a nation-wide and global basis. Apps that focus on local news falsely advertise <br />
	this ideal, and they often do not show relevant news material. My app has the goal of <br />
	of bringing the audience recent news coverage that includes the weather, local news, and <br />
	important facts that pertain to the customer. </p>
	<p class="fancy"> Once you start my app, the user will have to engage in a short registration process <br />
	which only asks for an email. This registration process will also include a survey which <br />
	which asks the user what types of news content would be preferred. This will create an <br />
	an algorithm that sorts out the type of news media that is displayed to the user. This sort <br />
	of preference control can be tweeked or edited according to the user's preference. The user <br />
	will be asked to give the app permission to use their location in order to process the local <br />
	content that will be displayed.</p>
	<p class="fancy"> Once users launch the app, they will be given a front page with the most significant news <br />
	of the day. They will be able to enter the app and will be shown several different pages to <br />
	to view. For example, the user will be able to navigate to the tech news, medical news, sports, <br />
	and weather at any time. If the user is curious, they can click on the tabs and choose to <br />
	their topic; afterwards, they can choose to read articles, watch videos, or view reports <br /> 
	as they wish. </p>
